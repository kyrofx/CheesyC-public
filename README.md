# CheesyC-public
Cheesy Care on the web! Made public without credentials.

Heres a really boring and quick intro to this project.

Cheesy Care is a service done by Team 254 at FRC events. 
The people who help Cheesy Care go around and help other teams with their robots, software, and other stuff. 
What this project aims to do is to simplify that process and make it really easy for the person going to help to know what is in need of helping before they even get to their pit. 
This right now doesn't function as I am in the middle of adding several functions (listed down below). If you want to check it out, its at https://cheesyc.kyro.dog 

Stuff in the demo right now:
* login/logout functions for both students and mentors
* form to send information to the students
* place to read the information
* account creation/deletion process
* API access for future use

Stuff that I want to add in the future:
* More information in the "place to read the information" (stuff like the next time we play together, if we're going to win that, etc)
* Better form (with more information, such as contact info and a specific person to ping in slack)
* Slack integration! 
* General cleanliness, better design

If you see an issue, create an issue! If you think you can Flask, create a pull request! If you wanna talk to me, my discord is @kyrofx. Feel free to send me a message. 
Please note I am on the pacific coast of the US, and I may be sleeping.
